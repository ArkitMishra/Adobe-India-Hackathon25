The platform will optionally integrate AI APIs to provide smart insights or summary reports from the uploaded data Description: These two MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack-based full-stack projects are designed for students to complete over a 10-week period. Each project is divided into 5-week modules with structured goals, guidance, and references for development. The purpose is to give hands-on experience with complete application development using the MERN stack.
